I am a last year economics student at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) with an interest in the area of ​​finance.The risk in this area is important to financial health and for the performance of the economy.
This cycle I have learned some matching learning and it is very interesting how the methodologies that are proposed in this field can be very useful in my career.
